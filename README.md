## **Goals**

To build the world's greatest and most fabulously extraordinarily stupendously marvellous Weather Forecaster.

## **Tasks**

Use the OpenWeather One Call API to retrieve weather data for user selected cities.

    ✅  provide a visible weather dashboard
    ✅  after a city is searched, current and future conditions are displayed
    ✅  displayed is the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index.
    ✅  UV index is displayed with a colour coding to illustrate whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.
    ✅  a five day forecast is displayed containing the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.
    ✅  when clicking on a previously searched city in the history, the weather current and 5 day forecast is again shown.
